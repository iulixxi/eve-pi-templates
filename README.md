# EVE PI Templates
Planetary Interaction (PI) templates for **EVE Online** designed for consistency and efficiency.
Layouts are standardized: **1 Command Center + 1 Launchpad + 25 factories** (where possible).

## Contents
- **T1 Extractor Template** – extractor planet with 8 factories for primary materials
- **T2 Factory Template** – 25 factory planet dedicated to Tier 2 production
- **T3 Factory Templates** – (WIP) 25 factory planets covering nearly all Tier 3 commodities

## Usage
1. Download the repository as a `.zip` file (from GitHub).
2. Extract the archive locally.
3. Copy all templates from the `src` folder into: `C:\Users\_YOUR_USER_\Documents\EVE\PlanetaryInteractionTemplates`
4. Launch **EVE Online** and import the templates when setting up your planets.

## Status
- ✅ T1 extractor template complete  
- ✅ T2 factory template complete  
- ⚙️ T3 factory templates – work in progress (almost all P3 commodities covered)

## Notes
- Templates assume **Command Center Upgrades V** for power/CPU.  
- All layouts route everything through a single Launchpad hub.  
- For T3 chains, stockpile T1 → T2 materials in advance to keep factories running.
